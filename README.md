## Overview

This project provides a user-friendly tool for image steganography, allowing you to embed secret messages within images without noticeable changes. To ensure the confidentiality of your hidden data, all messages are encrypted and can only be decrypted with the correct password.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Password-Protected Encryption**: Ensures only authorized users can decode hidden messages.
* **User-Friendly GUI**: A clean and simple graphical interface built with Tkinter for easy interaction.
* **Lightweight & Efficient**: Uses OpenCV and Pillow (PIL) for optimized and fast image processing.
* **Secure Data Hiding**: Messages are embedded into the least significant bits of image pixels, making them visually undetectable.
